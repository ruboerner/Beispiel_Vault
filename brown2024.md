> abstract:: The Rogaland Igneous Complex (RIC) in southern Norway intruded into Sveconorwegian granulite crust beginning ∼930 Ma. Three massif anorthosite bodies, Egersund–Ogna, Helleren and Åna-Sira, were intruded some 10 Myr later by the Bjerkreim–Sokndal layered intrusion. The Garsaknatt leuconorite and the ilmenite-rich Tellnes norite, one of the youngest rock in the complex at ∼920 Ma, intrude the anorthosite or nearby country rock. Magnetic mineralogy and palaeomagnetic studies carried out on the Tellnes norite, the Garsaknatt leuconorite and the surrounding Åna-Sira anorthosite, indicate the magnetization of all three bodies are dominated by hemo-ilmenite carrying the remanence as a thermochemical remanent magnetization, although magnetite is present in some samples. The three bodies yield steep negative inclinations with northwesterly declinations (Tellnes, I = −71.9°, D = 305.0°, α95 = 10.6°; Garsaknatt, I = −73.1°, D = 312.7°, α95 = 4.7°; and Åna-Sira, I = −81.2°, D = 326.3°, α95 = 6.7°). When combined with data from other bodies in the RIC, the older anorthosites have steeper inclinations, and higher palaeolatitudes, while the younger units have less steep inclinations and shallower palaeolatitudes by nearly 10°, indicating northward plate motion during cooling of the intrusions. Age of the remanence is difficult to determine precisely, however, best estimates are ∼910 Ma for the older anorthosites and ∼900 Ma for the younger intrusions. Although these differences are significant, a unified pole position (35.6° N, 215.1° E), combining all the 111 sites from the RIC, strongly supports the assumed position of southern Baltica in Rodinia at ∼900 MA.

> The location and spatial relationship of cratonic bodies in the past has long been of interest to geoscientists. From the ‘fit’ of Africa to South America to details of microplates, geological evidence has been pursued to investigate past continents and supercontinents.
