  abstract = {Abstract             The present paper studies so-called deep image prior (DIP) techniques in the context of ill-posed inverse problems. DIP networks have been recently introduced for applications in image processing; also first experimental results for applying DIP to inverse problems have been reported. This paper aims at discussing different interpretations of DIP and to obtain analytic results for specific network designs and linear operators. The main contribution is to introduce the idea of viewing these approaches as the optimization of Tikhonov functionals rather than optimizing networks. Besides theoretical results, we present numerical verifications.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Maar‐diatreme volcanoes are small volcanic structures with a funnel‐shaped crater surrounded by a tephra‐ring. They are usually formed by the explosive phreatomagmatic eruptions when groundwater comes into the contact with magma. We focus on such a structure in the geodynamically active western Eger Rift (Czech Republic) and present results from multidisciplinary geophysical investigation calibrated by drilling in the newly discovered Pleistocene Bažina maar. We evaluated morphological (LiDAR‐based DEM) data and confirmed the existence of a maar‐diatreme structure by combined geophysical methods. In the map view, they revealed circular negative gravity anomaly, funnel‐shape low‐resistivity anomaly, and strong magnetic anomaly. These results allowed for the optimal location of two boreholes in the maar crater, which evinced its contact with country rocks and lithologies of the maar‐diatreme filling. The drilling revealed coherent volcanic rocks and volcaniclastic deposits, moreover, it revealed a presence of a pyroclastic cone with the olivine nephelinite feeding conduit. Further investigations disclosed maar structure and subsequent pyroclastic cone(s) with several generations of eruptions and systematic decrease of water influence on the eruption style. Different eruption styles suggest a unique evolution of two volcanoes, one inside the other. The age of the Bažina maar eruption, estimated from the reverse polarity of the detected magnetic anomaly, implies that the effusion and solidification of the lava during the eruption must be older than 0.78~Ma (Pleistocene). This points to an active volcanism in the western Eger Rift in a span of ∼0.5~Ma, where Bažina represents the oldest (maybe opening) phase.           ,              Plain Language Summary                            Maars are small volcanoes formed by the explosive eruptions when water comes into the contact with magma. They can form topographic depressions, however, their discovery is not easy and they can be easily missed in the fields. We focused on a newly discovered depression Bažina in the western Eger Rift (Czech Republic), which was supposed to be such a maar. Combination of geophysical surveys and drilling revealed small volcano with a complex structure. Geophysical results proved its magmatic origin and allowed for the optimal location of two exploration boreholes. They evinced the maar contact with the country rocks, coherent volcanic rocks and volcaniclastic deposits with basaltic conduit. Further investigations disclosed several subsequent eruptions within the maar with different eruption styles, from maar‐forming eruption to Surtseyan style eruption and finally to Strombolian style eruption. These different eruption styles suggest the unique evolution of two volcanoes, one inside the other.

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Many geophysical inverse problems are known to be ill-posed and, thus, requiring some kind of regularization in order to provide a unique and stable solution. A possible approach to overcome the inversion ill-posedness consists in constraining the position of the model interfaces. For a grid-based parameterization, such a structurally constrained inversion can be implemented by adopting the usual smooth regularization scheme in which the local weight of the regularization is reduced where an interface is expected. By doing so, sharp contrasts are promoted at interface locations while standard smoothness constraints keep affecting the other regions of the model. In this work, we present a structurally constrained approach and test it on the inversion of frequency-domain electromagnetic induction (FD-EMI) data using a regularization approach based on the Minimum Gradient Support stabilizer, which is capable to promote sharp transitions everywhere in the model, i.e., also in areas where no structural a prioriinformation is available. Using 1D and 2D synthetic data examples, we compare the proposed approach to a structurally constrained smooth inversion as well as to more standard (i.e., not structurally constrained) smooth and sharp inversions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach helps in finding a better and more reliable reconstruction of the subsurface electrical conductivity distribution, including its structural characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows to promote sharp parameter variations in areas where no structural information are available. Lastly, we apply our structurally constrained scheme to FD-EMI field data collected at a field site in Eastern Germany to image the thickness of peat deposits along two selected profiles. In this field example, we use collocated constant offset ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data to derive structural a priori information to constrain the inversion of the FD-EMI data. The results of this case study demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The movement and deformation of the Earth’s crust and upper mantle provide critical insights into the evolution of earthquake processes and future earthquake potentials. Crustal deformation can be modeled by dislocation models that represent earthquake faults in the crust as defects in a continuum medium. In this study, we propose a physics-informed deep learning approach to model crustal deformation due to earthquakes. Neural networks can represent continuous displacement fields in arbitrary geometrical structures and mechanical properties of rocks by incorporating governing equations and boundary conditions into a loss function. The polar coordinate system is introduced to accurately model the displacement discontinuity on a fault as a boundary condition. We illustrate the validity and usefulness of this approach through example problems with strike-slip faults. This approach has a potential advantage over conventional approaches in that it could be straightforwardly extended to high dimensional, anelastic, nonlinear, and inverse problems.},

  abstract = {This article presents an in-depth study of CO2 injection monitoring in the Sleipner Field, focusing on the Utsira Formation. The research leverages advanced time-lapse inversion techniques and 4D seismic data analysis to enhance the accuracy of volume estimations and provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic behavior of the injected CO2 plume. The analysis encompasses cross correlation, time shift, predictability, and other key elements to yield robust insights into the reservoir’s response to CO2 injection. Cross-correlation analysis results of 60\% to 100\% outside the injection zone and less than 50\% within the injection zone reveal a distinct dissimilarity between the injection and non-injection zones, emphasizing phase, time, and frequency content changes due to CO2 injection. Time shifts are meticulously calibrated globally on a trace-by-trace basis, to account for shallow statics and velocity changes, improving the overall alignment of seismic data. Predictability analysis results of 0 to 0.34 within the injection zone and 0.45 to 0.96 at the background further reinforce the findings, highlighting high predictability values in areas untouched by production and markedly lower values within the injection zone. These results provide a measure of the reliability of the seismic data and its ability to reflect the subtle changes occurring in the reservoir. Crucially, the time-lapse inversion process excels in capturing the evolving state of the CO2 plume within the Utsira Formation. The seismic data reveals the migration and expansion of the plume over time and the dynamic nature of the reservoir’s response to CO2 injection. Integrating various data facets reduces non-uniqueness in inversion results, allowing for more precise volume estimations.},
